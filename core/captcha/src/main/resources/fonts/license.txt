	Beautiful and free fonts for all languages When text is rendered 
by a computer, sometimes characters are displayed as “tofu”. 
They are little boxes to indicate your device doesn’t have a font 
to display the text.

	Google has been developing a font family called Noto, which aims 
to support all languages with a harmonious look and feel. Noto is 
Google’s answer to tofu. The name noto is to convey the idea that 
Google’s goal is to see “no more tofu”. Noto has multiple styles 
and weights, and is freely available to all. The comprehensive set 
of fonts and tools used in our development is available in our 
GitHub repositories.
	Released over 75 new and updated font families, built using 
the open source pipeline and sources. Read more updates
